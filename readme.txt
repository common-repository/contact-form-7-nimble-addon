This CF7 addon integrates with Nimble CRM to automatically add leads to your account on form submission.

== Description ==
> *The plugin is currently in beta. Please take a second to report any issues you encounter either in our support forum or submit a bug report.*

Contact Form 7 - Nimble Addon plugin streamlines your lead generation process to help you import leads to your Nimble account automatically whenever CF7 form is submitted.
The plugin uses Nimble API to add a new lead record, it also checks to make sure the lead is new and will not create duplicate record.Note, this is an early beta release. Currently, the plugin will import the following fields:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Title
* Phone (work)
* Phone (mobile)
* Email
* NEW: Contact tags

We've included an easy to use field mapping interface to allow you to map your contact form fields with Nimble fields. Once you map fields, you must use the same form field tags throughout your forms to make sure information is being imported. For example, if you use `[first-name]` tag and that's what you used to map it to Nimble field, all forms must use `[first-name]` to import lead's first name.

**Usage Tip:** When your form submissions are emailed to the email connected with your Nimble, you will be able to view emails in the stream of the newly created lead. Any additional fields that were not imported, will be available in your email.
